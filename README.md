# Gender Equality and Economic Development: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python

This repository contains a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) project focused on gender equality and its relationship with socio-economic indicators. Using Python, this analysis uncovers trends, patterns, and disparities in education, labor force participation, health, leadership, and wage equality across the world.

## Context

Gender equality is a cornerstone of sustainable development. This project explores how various indicators—such as tertiary education enrollment, labor force participation, maternal health, wage gaps, and leadership representation—interact with economic factors like GDP to shape gender parity outcomes. Through data visualization and trend analysis, the project provides actionable insights into global progress and challenges.

## Sections of the Analysis

### 1. Education as a Catalyst
**Objective:** Explore tertiary enrollment rates of women across the world over time.  
**Visualization:** A Choropleth Map visualizes global trends in female tertiary enrollment from 1990 to recent years.  

### 2. Economic Participation - A Mixed Picture
**Objective:** Analyze female labor force participation rates and their relationship with GDP per capita.  
**Visualizations:**
- A Bubble Scatter Plot shows the relationship between female labor force participation and GDP per capita over time.
- A Regional Line Plot highlights trends in female labor force participation across different regions.  

### 3. The Health-Wealth Connection
**Objective:** Examine the relationship between maternal mortality rates and GDP per capita.  
**Visualization:** A Scatter Plot compares maternal mortality rates against GDP per capita for countries worldwide.  

### 4. The Stubborn Wage Gap
**Objective:** Analyze gender wage gaps across countries over time.  
**Visualization:** A Stacked Bar Chart shows the gender wage gap by country and year.  

### 5. Breaking the Glass Ceiling
**Objective:** Explore women's representation in legislation and leadership positions across countries.  
**Visualization:** A Heatmap highlights the proportion of seats held by women in parliaments and senior management roles over time.  


## Key Takeaways

- **Education** remains a critical driver of gender equality. While progress has been made globally, disparities persist in low-income regions.
- **Female labor force participation** is influenced by economic factors such as GDP per capita but also by cultural norms and regional policies.
- **Maternal mortality rates** highlight stark inequalities but also show that targeted healthcare interventions can yield significant improvements even in low-income countries.
- **The gender wage gap** persists globally despite progress in other areas of gender equality, requiring systemic reforms to address pay inequity.
- **Women's representation in leadership positions** shows progress in some countries due to quotas but remains limited overall, particularly in business roles.

## Future Work

- Expand analysis with predictive models (e.g., regression or clustering) to forecast trends or group countries based on gender equality metrics.
- Incorporate additional datasets on cultural or policy factors influencing gender equality outcomes (e.g., education reforms or workplace policies).
- Create interactive dashboards for easier exploration of insights by policymakers or researchers.
